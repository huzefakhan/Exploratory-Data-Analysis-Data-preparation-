# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Data-preparation

The First Investigation Data scientists in their lingo call ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’.

Exploratory Data Analysis refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns,to spot anomalies,to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.

It is a good practice to understand the data first and try to gather as many insights from it. EDA is all about making sense of data in hand,before getting them dirty with it.

This file include the Key Steps involved in Data preparation:
